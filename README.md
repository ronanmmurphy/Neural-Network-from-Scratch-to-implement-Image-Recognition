# Neural-Network-from-Scratch-to-implement-Image-Recognition
Created a Feed-forward Neural Network with back-propagation from scratch without the use of Python libraries. Gradient Descent was implemented to update the weights of the NN as the model trained. Over 50,000 large RGB images (32x32) trained the model in batches with 10,000 different images used for the test data. The model produced binary classification to differentiate between frogs and deer producing a 91% accuracy for test and validation data.  Made enhancements by adding extra neural layers and optimal activation functions increased the model's evaluation metrics, scoring 93% on validation and test data.
